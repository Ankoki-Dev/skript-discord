# skript-discord  
Welcome to (another) discord addon for skript!  
This addon's purpose is to attempt to make long-lasting support for JDA discord bots.  

This addon utilises the (at the time of writing this) unreleased StructureAPI Skript, which is able to be downloaded from this repo, under the name of `SKRIPT-STRUCTURES.jar`.  

More will be added here in time, and on to the wiki.
